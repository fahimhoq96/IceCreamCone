# IceCreamCone
Finding best model using Regression analysis in R

Flour is used in baking ice cream cones. The flour content contains ash, moisture, protein etc. The percentage of these ingredients are given in the data below as well as the viscosity of the flour used in baking ice cream cones. My objective was to find a model that best describes the relationship between the response variable viscosity with the explanatory variables: moisture, protein, and ash.
